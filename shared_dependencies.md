Shared Dependencies:

- **Flask**: Required by `server/app.py`, `server/views.py`, `server/auth.py`, `server/error_handlers.py`, and `server/__init__.py` for setting up the API server and routing.
- **Python-dotenv**: Used by `server/app.py` and `server/__init__.py` to load environment variables from `server/.env`.
- **Requests**: Likely used by `server/views.py` for making external API calls.
- **Werkzeug**: Utilized by `server/auth.py` for password hashing and authentication.
- **React**: Required by all `client/src/*.tsx` files for building the frontend components.
- **TypeScript**: Used across all `client/src/*.tsx` and `client/src/*.ts` files for type safety.
- **Firebase**: Used by `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` and `client/src/services/authService.ts` for authentication.
- **Axios**: Potentially used by `client/src/services/logService.ts` for making API requests to the Flask server.
- **Environment Variables**: Shared between `server/.env` for server configuration and `client/.env` for client-side configuration.
- **Log Schema**: Shared between `server/models.py` for log data structure and `client/src/types/index.d.ts` for type definitions.
- **Auth Schema**: Shared between `server/models.py` for user authentication data structure and `client/src/types/index.d.ts` for type definitions.
- **Error Handling Functions**: Defined in `server/error_handlers.py` and potentially used across various server files like `server/views.py` and `server/auth.py`.
- **Logging Functions**: Used in `server/utils.py` and potentially across `server/views.py`, `server/auth.py`, and `server/error_handlers.py` for logging to `server/logs.log`.
- **API Key**: Defined in `server/.env` and used in `server/auth.py` for access control.
- **Username and Password**: Used in `server/auth.py` for basic access authentication and potentially in `client/src/services/authService.ts` for login system.
- **DOM Element IDs**: Defined in `client/public/index.html` and used in `client/src/index.tsx` and other React components for rendering and JavaScript interactions.
- **Function Names**: Such as `authenticate`, `proxy_request`, `log_request`, `handle_error` shared between various server files (`server/views.py`, `server/auth.py`, `server/utils.py`, `server/error_handlers.py`) and client services (`client/src/services/authService.ts`, `client/src/services/logService.ts`).
- **Message Names**: Used for error messages, log entries, and other notifications, shared between server error handlers (`server/error_handlers.py`) and client components (`client/src/components/*`).
- **Gitignore Files**: Shared `.gitignore` rules in `client/.gitignore` and `server/.gitignore` for excluding files from version control.

These shared dependencies are essential for ensuring that both the Flask API server and the React frontend work together cohesively and maintain a consistent structure and behavior across the application.
